    CSGO: 
    I will always remember CSGO because that is the game that Started my Friend Group The Tea House.
    together with one of my best friends i played a game of csgo and we met 2 British guys one of those British Guys would become one of my best friends over the years and have an immense positive impact on my life, but after that csgo game we played more together. And after a while of playing together we started to add more people to our group The tea House began to grow and till this day everyone in The tea house will always have a special place in my heart and I would do anything for them. And that is why CSGO will always have a special place in my heart.

    World Of warcraft:
    WoW Will always have a special place in my heart Because it thought me to never Give up and that the more time you spend on something the better it will be. I never had something that actually showed me that until recent times and that was WoW.
